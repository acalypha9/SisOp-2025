<b>1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?</b>

The three main purposes of an operating system are:
<ol>
<li><b>To provide an environment</b> for a computer user to execute programs on computer hardware in a convenient and efficient manner.</li>
<li><b>To allocate the separate resources</b> of the computer as needed to solve the problem given. The allocation process should be as fair and efficient as possible.</li>
<li><b>To supervise the execution</b> of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.</li>
</ol>

<b>1.2 What is the main goal of a multiprogramming system?</b>

The main goal of a multiprogramming system is to increase CPU utilization by organizing jobs so that the CPU always has one to execute. This is achieved by allowing multiple jobs to reside in memory simultaneously, so when one job waits for I/O operations, another can use the CPU.

<b>1.3 What is the main advantage of a multiprocessor system?</b>

Multiprocessor systems have several advantages:
<ol>
<li><b>Increased throughput</b>: By increasing the number of processors, more work can be completed in a shorter time.</li>
<li><b>Economy of scale</b>: Multiprocessor systems can cost less than equivalent multiple single-processor systems because they can share peripherals, mass storage, and power supplies.</li>
<li><b>Increased reliability</b>: The failure of one processor does not halt the system; the remaining processors can continue operation, providing graceful degradation.</li>
</ol>

<b>1.4 What are the differences between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing?</b>

<b>Asymmetric multiprocessing</b>: Each processor is assigned a specific task. A master processor controls the system; the other processors either look to the master for instruction or have predefined tasks. This scheme defines a master-slave relationship.</br></br>
<b>Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)</b>: Each processor performs all tasks within the operating system. All processors are peers; no master-slave relationship exists. Each processor has its own set of registers and main memory, but they share the same physical memory.

<b>1.5 What is the main function of the memory management unit (MMU)?</b>

The MMU translates logical addresses generated by the CPU into physical addresses in memory. This hardware device maps virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling processes to have their own address spaces and ensuring memory protection by restricting access to unauthorized regions.

---

<b>1.6 What is the purpose of system calls?</b>

System calls provide an interface between a running program and the operating system. They allow user-level processes to request services of the operating system, such as file operations, process control, and communication. System calls are essential for accessing hardware resources and performing privileged operations that user programs cannot directly execute.

<b>1.7 What is the difference between a system program and an application program?</b>

A <b>System program</b> is software designed to manage and control the computer hardware and provide a platform for running application programs. It includes the operating system, device drivers, utility programs, and system services that ensure the efficient functioning of a computer. System programs work in the background, enabling the interaction between hardware and software.</br></br>
An <b>Application programs</b> is software designed for end-users to perform specific tasks. It runs on top of the system software and allows users to accomplish activities such as word processing, web browsing, or gaming.

<b>1.8 What is the main advantage of a microkernel over a monolithic kernel?</b>

The main advantage of a microkernel over a monolithic kernel is its modularity and extensibility. In a microkernel architecture, only essential core functions (such as communication between hardware and software) reside in the kernel, while other services (like device drivers, file systems, and network protocols) run in user space. This design leads to:
<ol>
<li><b>Improved reliability and security</b>: Since most services run in user mode, failures in these services are less likely to crash the entire system.</li>
<li><b>Easier maintenance and extensibility</b>: Services can be added, removed, or updated without modifying the kernel, facilitating system evolution.</li>
</ol>

<b>1.9 What is the role of a bootstrap program in a computer system?</b>

The <b>bootstrap program</b>, also known as the bootloader, is a special program stored in the computer's read-only memory (ROM) or firmware. Its primary role is to initialize system hardware and load the operating system kernel into memory during the system startup process.

<b>1.10 What is the main purpose of an interrupt?</b>

An <b>interrupt</b> is a signal that prompts the operating system to stop and determine how to respond to an event. Interrupts provide a way for external devices or software to get the attention of the CPU, allowing the system to react promptly to important events, such as input from a keyboard or mouse, or the completion of an I/O operation.

---

<b>1.11 What are the differences between a trap and an interrupt?</b>

A <b>trap</b> is a type of software-generated interrupt that occurs due to an error in a program or when a program requests a system service. It happens synchronously with the execution of instructions, meaning it occurs at a specific point in the program's execution. Traps are commonly used for exception handling, such as when a program attempts to divide by zero or access an invalid memory location. They are also used for system calls, allowing user programs to request services from the operating system, like reading a file or allocating memory.</br></br>
An <b>interrupt</b> is a signal generated by hardware or software to alert the CPU that an event requiring attention has occurred. Unlike traps, interrupts occur asynchronously, meaning they can happen at any time, independent of the currently executing instruction. Interrupts are used to handle external events, such as user input from a keyboard or mouse, the completion of a disk operation, or a timer signal. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU temporarily pauses its current execution, processes the interrupt, and then resumes the previous task.
